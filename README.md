# 👋 Hi, I’m @DivineProgram

- 📋 My general knowledge in programming tends to be more limited than others but my intuition allows me to unlock ideas and logic that most people wouldn't be able to think of, which is my personal strength
- 🌱 When something interests me, I will focus on improving on one area of my abilities until I've got a solid understanding and intuition for how to use and when to use different resources, packages and systems
- 🎮 I have an interest in games design and development, as shown through my ’Minegames 3’ project, however I do not have the skills necessary to make a standalone game, as of yet
- 🐍 I am currently learning Python, in order to build algorithmic programs and makeshift projects
