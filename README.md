## ðŸ“š I'm @DivineProgram, a university student studying software engineering!

- ðŸ“‹ My greatest skill is that, although the knowledge I have is not very expansive, I have honed my ability to use what I have, to create effective and innovative solutions, in a ways unforseen by my peers.
- ðŸŒ± My strengths are primarily in front-end web development, with in-depth knowledge in Python, and intermediate understanding of C.
- ðŸ’» Currently I am studying the C language, but previous projects have included frontend and backend web-dev, game development, and physics engines.
