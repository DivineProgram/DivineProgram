## ðŸ“š I'm @DivineProgram, currently a student in my last year of Sixth Form, nearing my venture to university!

- ðŸ“‹ My greatest skill is that, although the knowledge I have is not very expansive, I have honed my ability to use what I have, to create effective and innovative solutions, in a way unforseen by my peers.
- ðŸŒ± My strengths are primarily in Python, with some elementary skills in Javascript.
- ðŸ’» I try experiment with a range of technical areas; currently I am working upon my web-development skills, in both backend and frontend. In the past, I've experimented with game-development, physics simulations, and creating simple algorithmic programs.
